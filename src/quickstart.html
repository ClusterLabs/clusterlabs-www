	  <h2>Quickstart Editions</h2>
	  <p>
	    We have a quickstart edition for each major distro. To
	    continue, select the distribution you'll be using:
	    <ul>
	      <li>
		<a href="quickstart-redhat.html">RHEL 7</a> (and clones such as CentOS),
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<a href="quickstart-redhat-6.html">RHEL 6</a> (and clones such as CentOS),
	      </li>
	      <li>
		openSUSE and <a href="quickstart-suse.html">SLES 12</a>,
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<a href="quickstart-suse-11.html">SLES 11</a>, or
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<a href="quickstart-ubuntu.html">Ubuntu Precise LTS</a>
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	  </p>
	  <h2>Why Does Each Distribution Have its Own Quickstart?</h2>
	  <p>
            Now that all distributions have standardized on Corosync 2 or
            greater as the underlying cluster layer, the differences are
            minimal.
	  </p>
	  <p>
            However, in the past, Pacemaker also supported Corosync 1 (with or
            without CMAN) as well as Heartbeat. Different distributions
            supported different cluster layers, requiring different set-up.
            We call each combination of Pacemaker and cluster layer a "stack".
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    For example, on RHEL6 the supported stack is based on CMAN
	    which has APIs Pacemaker can use to obtain the membership
	    and quroum information it needs.  Although CMAN uses
	    Corosync underneath, it is configured via cluster.conf and
	    Pacemaker is started as a separate init script.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    However SLES11 doesn't ship CMAN, so its users configure
	    corosync.conf directly and enable a custom plugin that
	    gets loaded into Corosync (because Corosync 1.4 doesn't
	    have the quorum and membership APIs needed by Pacemaker).
	    This plugin also starts Pacemaker automatically when
	    Corosync is started.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    To confuse things further, SLES users start Corosync with
	    the openAIS init script because it used to be part of that
	    project.

	    options and how they relate to cluster filesystems in particular.
