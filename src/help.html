		<h1>Getting Help</h1>
	  </header>

	  <p>
	    A good first step is always to check out
	    the <a href="/faq.html">FAQ</a>
	    and <a href="/pacemaker/doc/">documentation</a>.  Otherwise, many
	    members of the community hang out
	    on <a href="irc://irc.freenode.org#clusterlabs">irc</a>
	    and are happy to answer questions.  We are spread out over
	    many timezones though (and have day jobs), so you may need
	    to be patient when waiting for a reply.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Extended or complex issues might be better sent to the
	    relevant <a href="https://wiki.clusterlabs.org/wiki/Mailing_lists">mailing list</a>
	    (you'll need to subscribe in order to send messages).
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    People new to the project, or Open Source generally, are
	    encouraged to
	    read <a href="http://www.mikeash.com/getting_answers.html">Getting
	    Answers</a> by Mike Ash from Rogue Amoeba.  It provides
	    some very good tips on effective communication with groups
	    such as this one. Following the advice it contains will
	    greatly increase the chance of a quick and helpful reply.
	  </p>

	  <p>Bugs and other problems can also be reported
	    via <a href="https://bugs.clusterlabs.org/">Bugzilla</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Or if you already know the
	    solution, <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">submit
	    a patch</a> against
	    our <a href="https://github.com/ClusterLabs/pacemaker">GitHub
	    repository</a>.
	  </p>

      <p>
        The development of most of the ClusterLabs-related projects take place as part of
        the <a href="https://github.com/ClusterLabs/">ClusterLabs</a> organization at Github,
        and the source code and issue trackers for these projects can be found there.
      </p>
