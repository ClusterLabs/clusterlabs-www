ClusterLabs is an informal, volunteer-driven, online community.

## Resources

* [Mailing
  lists](https://projects.clusterlabs.org/w/clusterlabs/clusterlabs_mailing_lists/)
  are the primary means of communication, including support
* A [GitHub organization](https://github.com/ClusterLabs) hosts most projects'
  source code repositories
* A [wiki](https://projects.clusterlabs.org/w/) provides how-to's and other
  helpful information
* A [project manager](https://projects.clusterlabs.org/) tracks development
  plans
* Each project has its own bug tracker. Some use GitHub issues. Pacemaker uses
  [bugs.clusterlabs.org](https://bugs.clusterlabs.org/).
* The #clusterlabs IRC channel on irc.libera.chat has low activity but is
  another way to reach some users and developers

## Events

The community periodically gathers in person for [ClusterLabs
Summits](https://projects.clusterlabs.org/w/clusterlabs/summits/).

## Be a part

If you find ClusterLabs software useful, consider giving back in some way:

* Let people know about your experience with the software (in person, email,
  blog posts, social media, etc.)
* Participate in mailing list discussions
* Create or update pages on the ClusterLabs wiki
* Contribute source code or documentation patches to individual projects
* Attend summits
* Use it on [Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux](https://www.redhat.com/en/store/high-availability-add)
  or [SUSE Linux Enterprise
  Server](https://www.suse.com/products/highavailability/).
  Red Hat and SUSE fund the majority of our work, and using it on
  their products helps ensure they continue to see it as a priority.
