## Documentation

* [Pacemaker](/projects/pacemaker/doc/) documentation is the best place to
  start
* The <a href="https://projects.clusterlabs.org/w/">ClusterLabs wiki</a> has
  the [ClusterLabs FAQ](https://projects.clusterlabs.org/w/clusterlabs/faq/),
  how-to's, tips, and other information that doesn't make it into the project
  manuals.

## Community support

  lists](https://projects.clusterlabs.org/w/clusterlabs/clusterlabs_mailing_lists/)
  are the primary means of communication and support for the ClusterLabs
  community.
* The #clusterlabs IRC channel on irc.libera.chat has low activity but is
  another way to reach some users and developers offering help
