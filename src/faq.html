	  <p class="question">Q: Where can I get Pacemaker?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Pacemaker ships as part of most modern
	    distributions, so you can usually just launch your
	    favorite package manager on:
	    <ul>
	      <li>openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)</li>
	      <li>Fedora and derivatives such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
	      and CentOS</li>
	      <li>Debian and derivatives such as Ubuntu (with the exception of
	      Debian 8 "jessie", for which see the <a
	      href="https://wiki.debian.org/Debian-HA">Debian-HA team</a> for
	      details)</li>
	      <li>Gentoo</li>
	    </ul>
	  </p>
	  <p class="answer">
	    If all else fails, you can try installing from <a
	    href="https://github.com/ClusterLabs/pacemaker">source</a>.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: Is there any documentation?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Yes. You can find the set relevant to
	    your version in our <a href="/doc">documentation
	    index</a>.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: Where should I ask questions?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Often basic questions can be answered
	    on <a href="irc://irc.freenode.org#clusterlabs">irc</a>,
	    but sending them to the
	    <a href="https://wiki.clusterlabs.org/wiki/Mailing_lists">mailing list</a> is
	      always a good idea so that everyone can benefit from the
	      answer.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: Do I need shared storage?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: No.  We can help manage it if you have
	    some, but Pacemaker itself has no need for shared storage.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: Which cluster filesystems does Pacemaker support?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Pacemaker supports the
	    popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCFS2">OCFS2</a>
	    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFS2">GFS2</a>
	    filesystems.  As you'd expect, you can use them on top of
	    real disks or network block devices
	    like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Replicated_Block_Device">DRBD</a>.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: What kind of applications can I manage with Pacemaker?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Pacemaker is application-agnostic, meaning
	    anything that can be scripted can be made highly available,
	    provided the script conforms to one of the supported standards:
	    <a href="/pacemaker/doc/en-US/Pacemaker/1.1/html/Pacemaker_Explained/_linux_standard_base.html">LSB</a>,
	    <a href="/pacemaker/doc/en-US/Pacemaker/1.1/html/Pacemaker_Explained/s-resource-supported.html#_open_cluster_framework">OCF</a>, 
	    <a href="/pacemaker/doc/en-US/Pacemaker/1.1/html/Pacemaker_Explained/_systemd.html">Systemd</a>,
	    or <a href="/pacemaker/doc/en-US/Pacemaker/1.1/html/Pacemaker_Explained/_upstart.html">Upstart</a>.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: Can I use Pacemaker with Heartbeat?</p>
          <p class="answer">A: Only Pacemaker versions less than 2.0.0. See
          this <a href="http://www.linux-ha.org/wiki/Configuration">documentation</a> for details.</p>
	  <p class="question">Q: Can I use Pacemaker with CMAN?</p>
          <p class="answer">A: Only Pacemaker versions greater than or equal to
          1.1.5 and less than 2.0.0. See the
	  <a href="/pacemaker/doc/deprecated/en-US/Pacemaker/1.1-plugin/html/Clusters_from_Scratch/ch08s02.html">documentation</a>
	  for details.</p>

	  <p class="question">Q: Can I use Pacemaker with Corosync 1.x?</p>
          <p class="answer">A: Only Pacemaker versions less than 2.0.0. You will need to configure
          <a href="http://corosync.org">Corosync</a> to load Pacemaker's custom plugin. See
          the <a href="/pacemaker/doc/deprecated/en-US/Pacemaker/1.1-plugin/html/Clusters_from_Scratch/s-configure-corosync.html">documentation</a> for details.</p>

          <p class="question">Q: Can I use Pacemaker with Corosync 2.x or greater?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Yes. This is the only option supported by
	  Pacemaker 2.0.0 and greater. See the <a
	  href="/pacemaker/doc/en-US/Pacemaker/1.1/html/Clusters_from_Scratch/_cluster_software_installation.html">documentation</a>
          for details.</p>

	  <p class="question">Q: Do I need a fencing device?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Yes.  Fencing is the only 100% reliable
	    way to ensure the integrity of your data and that
	    applications are only active on one host.  Although
	    Pacemaker is technically able to function without Fencing,
	    there are a good reasons SUSE and Red Hat will not support
	    such a configuration.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: Do I need to know XML to configure Pacemaker?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: No. Although Pacemaker uses XML as its
	    native configuration format, there
	    exist <a href="/#addons">2 CLIs and at least 4 GUIs</a>
	    that present the configuration in a human friendly format.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: How do I synchronize the cluster configuration?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Any changes to Pacemaker's
       	    configuration are automatically replicated to other
       	    machines.  The configuration is also versioned, so any
       	    offline machines will be updated when they return.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: Should I choose pcs or crmsh?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Arguably the best advice is to use
	    whichever one comes with your distro.  This is the one
	    that will be tailored to that environment, receive regular
	    bugfixes and feature in the documentation.
	  </p>
	  <p class="answer">
	    Of course, for years people have been side-loading all of
	    Pacemaker onto enterprise distros that didn't ship it, so
	    doing the same for just a configuration tool should be
	    easy if your favorite distro does not ship your favorite
	    tool.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: What if my question isn't here?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: See the <a href="help.html">getting help</a> section and let us know!</p>
