      </header>

	  <p class="question">Q: Where can I get Pacemaker?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Pacemaker ships as part of most common Linux
	    distributions, including CentOS, Debian, Fedora, Gentoo, OpenSUSE,
	    Red Hat Enterpise Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, Ubuntu, and
	    their derivatives, so you can usually just launch your favorite
	    package manager.
	  </p>
	  <p class="answer">
	    If all else fails, you can try installing from <a
	    href="https://github.com/ClusterLabs/pacemaker">source</a>.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: Is there any documentation?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Yes. You can find the set relevant to
	    your version in our <a href="/doc">documentation
	    index</a>.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: Where should I ask questions?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: The ClusterLabs
	    <a href="https://lists.clusterlabs.org/mailman/listinfo/">mailing lists</a>
	    are usually the best place, as there is an active community with a wide
	    range of experience, and the answers will be archived to benefit
	    all users. There is also the 
	    <a href="irc://irc.libera.chat/#clusterlabs">#clusterlabs IRC channel on Libera</a>
	    for more immediate gratification, though with fewer participants.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: What kind of applications can I manage with Pacemaker?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Pacemaker has no direct intelligence about
	    specific services. Instead, it relies on resource agents, which are
	    small applications (often shell scripts) that provide a
	    standardized, generic interface to particular services. This means
	    that any service can be made highly available, using a script
	    conforming to one of the supported standards:
	    <a href="http://refspecs.linuxbase.org/LSB_3.0.0/LSB-PDA/LSB-PDA/iniscrptact.html">LSB ("init scripts")</a>,
	    <a href="https://github.com/ClusterLabs/OCF-spec/tree/master/ra">OCF resource agents</a>, 
	    and depending on the environment and options selected when
	    Pacemaker was built, systemd units, upstart, and
	    <a href="http://nagios-plugins.org/doc/guidelines.html">Nagios Plugins</a>.
	    The ClusterLabs <a href="https://github.com/ClusterLabs/resource-agents">resource-agents</a>
	    project provides a set of OCF agents for common services, and other
	    projects provide additional agents.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: Do I need shared storage?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: No. Pacemaker can manage shared storage, and
	    there are fencing techniques that can utilize shared storage,
	    but Pacemaker itself does not require it.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: Which cluster filesystems does Pacemaker support?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Pacemaker can support any filesystem with an appropriate
	    resource agent. The resource-agents project provides agents for
	    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCFS2">OCFS2</a>
	    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFS2">GFS2</a>.
	    You can use these cluster filesystems with physical disks or
	    network block devices such as
	    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Replicated_Block_Device">DRBD</a>.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: What does Pacemaker use for cluster quorum and communication?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Pacemaker relies on external software for
	    cluster formation. Pacemaker 2.0.0 and above supports only Corosync
	    version 2.0 or above for this purpose. Older Pacemaker versions
	    additionally supported <a href="http://linux-ha.org/wiki/Heartbeat">Heartbeat</a>
	    and Corosync 1 with either CMAN or the Pacemaker plugin.</p>

	  <p class="question">Q: Does my cluster need fencing?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Yes.</p>
	
	  <p class="question">Q: No, really, isn't fencing optional?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Fencing is the only way to recover from certain
	    failure scenarios and ensure the integrity of your data by avoiding
	    a "split-brain" situation. Although Pacemaker is technically able
	    to function without fencing, organizations that provide commercial
	    support generally require it, for good reason.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: How is Pacemaker configured?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Pacemaker uses XML as its native configuration
	    format, but users do not have to deal with XML directly. Pacemaker
	    provides low-level command-line tools for common tasks, and other
	    projects provide more user-friendly, high-level
	    <a href="components.html#addons">command-line and graphical user interfaces</a>.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: How do I synchronize the cluster configuration?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Any changes to Pacemaker's
       	    configuration are automatically replicated to other
       	    machines.  The configuration is also versioned, so any
       	    offline machines will be updated when they return.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: Should I choose pcs or the crm shell as a high-level interface?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Arguably the best advice is to use
	    whichever one comes with your distro.  This is the one
	    that will be tailored to that environment, receive regular
	    bugfixes and feature in the documentation.
	  </p>
	  <p class="answer">
	    Of course, if you have a strong preference, you can build your
	    favorite configuration tool from source if your distro doesn't ship
	    it.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: What if my question isn't here?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: See the <a href="help.html">getting help</a> section and let us know!</p>
