	  <h1>SLES 12</h1>
	  <h2>Install</h2>
	  <p>
	    Pacemaker ships as part of the
	    SUSE <a href="https://www.suse.com/products/highavailability/">High
	    Availability Extension</a>. To install, follow the provided
        documentation. It is also available in openSUSE Leap and openSUSE
        Tumbleweed.
	  </p>

	  <h2>Create the Cluster</h2>
	  <p>
	    The supported stack on SLES12 is based on Corosync 2.x.
	  </p>

	  <p>
        To get started, install the cluster stack on all nodes.
      </p>
	  <p class="command">
[ALL] # zypper install ha-cluster-bootstrap
      </p>
      
	  <p>
        First we initialize the cluster on the first machine (node1):
      </p>
	  <p class="command">
[ONE] # ha-cluster-init
      </p>

	  <p>
        Now we can join the cluster from the second machine (node2):
      </p>
	  <p class="command">
[ONE] # ha-cluster-join -c node1
      </p>

	  <p>
        These two steps create and start a basic cluster together with the
        <a href="https://hawk-ui.github.io/">HAWK</a> web interface. If given
        additional arguments, <tt>ha-cluster-init</tt> can also configure
        STONITH, OCFS2 and an administration IP address as part of initial
        configuration. It is also possible to choose whether to use multicast
        or unicast for corosync communication.
      </p>
	  <p>
        For more details on <tt>ha-cluster-init</tt>, see the output of
        <tt>ha-cluster-init --help</tt>.
      </p>

	  <h2>Set Cluster Options</h2>
	  <p>
	    For demonstration purposes, we will force the cluster to
	    move services after a single failure:
	  </p>
	  <p class="command">
[ONE] # crm configure property migration-threshold=1
	  </p>

	  <h2>Add a Resource</h2>
	  <p>
	    Lets add a cluster service, we'll choose one doesn't
	    require any configuration and works everywhere to make
	    things easy.  Here's the command:
	  </p>
	  <p class="command">
[ONE] # crm configure primitive my_first_svc Dummy op monitor interval=120s
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    "<strong>my_first_svc</strong>" is the name the service
	    will be known as.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    "<strong>Dummy</strong>" tells Pacemaker
	    which script to use
	    (<a href="https://github.com/ClusterLabs/pacemaker/blob/master/extra/resources/Dummy">Dummy</a>
	    - an agent that's useful as a template and for guides like
	    this one), which namespace it is in (pacemaker) and what
	    standard it conforms to
	    (<a href="/pacemaker/doc/en-US/Pacemaker/1.1-crmsh/html/Pacemaker_Explained/s-resource-supported.html#_open_cluster_framework">OCF</a>).
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    "<strong>op monitor interval=120s</strong>" tells Pacemaker to
	    check the health of this service every 2 minutes by
	    calling the agent's <strong>monitor</strong> action.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    You should now be able to see the service running using:
	  </p>
          <p class="command">
[ONE] # crm status
	  </p>

	  <h2>Simulate a Service Failure</h2>
	  <p>
	    We can simulate an error by telling the service stop
	    directly (without telling the cluster):
	  </p>
	  <p class="command">
[ONE] # crm_resource --resource my_first_svc --force-stop
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    If you now run <strong>crm_mon</strong> in interactive
	    mode (the default), you should see (within the monitor
	    interval - 2 minutes) the cluster notice
	    that <strong>my_first_svc</strong> failed and move it to
	    another node.
	  </p>
	  <p>
        You can also watch the transition from the HAWK dashboard, by going
        to <tt>https://node1:7630</tt>.
